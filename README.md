# Keyhole Software Neural Net Reference Application
Simple Neural Net implementation, Taken from the MNIST Nueral Net example implementation. 

UI is implemented in `ReactJS` and server side API/Nueral Net is implemented in `GO` 

Online DEMO can be accessed [HERE](https://khs-neural-net.herokuapp.com)






# Installing Running 

1. Install Go and Node.js
2. Clone Repo in Go 'SRC' directory 
3. Open console in cloned repo directory and perform these commands 

```
 $ npm install
 $ npm run build       // Builds React Bundle 
 $ go build            // Build API server and web server
 $ ./khs-neural-net    // Executes Go 
```

4. Open browser to http://localhost:8000
